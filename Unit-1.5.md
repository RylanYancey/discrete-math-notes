# Unit 1.5

## 1.5.1

consider the proposition: *p: n is an odd integer*
^ not a proposition; does not depend on p

Propositional Function - P(x) - a statement involving the variable x and let D be a set. D is the domain of P. 

P(n) = n is an odd integer
^ this is a proposition

D, or the Domain of Discourse, specifies the allowable values for x. 

## 1.5.2

## 1.5.3

A propositional function is either True or False

## 1.5.4

for every x, P(x) 

means for every x, P(x) is true - said to be a universally quantified statement. 

upside down AxP(x) is another way to write a universal quantified statement

## Example 1.5.5

for every x (x^2 >= 0)

the domain of discourse is R. the statement is true because, for every real number, x, it is true that the square of x is positive or zero. 

## Example 1.5.6

for every x (x^2 - 1 > 0) is false, because if I input 0 or 1 I get -1 or 0, which are less than or equal to 0. 

## 1.5.9

Existentially Quantified Statement

there exists x, P(x)

this statement is true if there is at least 1 value that returns true. 

## Example 1.5.10

There exists an x for (x / (x^2 + 1) = 2/5)

this is true because 2 evaluates to true for this expression.

## Example 1.5.11

There exists an x, which is a real number, for (1 / (x^2 + 1) > 1)

this statement is false becuase x^2 will always be 1 / positive number, which is less than 1. 

## Theory 1.5.14 *

Generalized De Morgan's Laws for Logic

if P is a propositional function, each pair of propositions in (a) and (b) has the same truth values (i.e. either both arer true or both are false)

## Example 1.5.17

Some birds cannot fly

Let P(x) be the propositional function "x flies". Becuase of De Morgans laws, the we can imply the negation "Every bird can fly".  ig

## notes

Universal Quantifier is basically "AND" 

Existential Modifier is basically "OR"

Not every x P(x) == at least one x if not P(x)
