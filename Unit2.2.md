# Proof By Contradiction

p -> q
direct proof

p ^ ~q => negation of the conclusion

r ^ ~r => must always be false. 

p -> q == (p ^ ~q) -> (r ^ ~r)

# Proof by Cases

used when the original hypothesis naturally divides itself into various cases
for example, the hypothesis "x is a real number" can be divided into cases: (a) x is a nonnegative real number and b x is a negative real number.
