# Unit 1.1 - Sets

## Definitions

set = collection of objects.

$$A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$

order does not matter in a set.
every element in a set is unique. 

large sets are described by listing a property.

$$B = \\{x | x \text{ is a positive, even integer} \\}$$

a set may also contain any kind of elements whatsoever, and they need not be the same type.

$$C = \\{4.5, \text{Lady Gaga}, \pi, 14\\}$$

sets may also contain sets within themselves.

- Z => set of integers
- Q => set of rational numbers
- R => set of real numbers

- \+ => positives only
- \- => negatives only

if X is a finite set, we definte |X| as the Cardinality of X. Cardinality is the number of elements, no matter what they are.
- A = {NULL} cardinality = 1
- A = {1, 2, 3} cardinality = 3
- A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} cardinality = 2

Sets can also be subsets of other sets:

$$\text{X} \subseteq \text{Y}$$

this means X is a subset, or is equal to, Y. 
There can also be proper subsets, which means X cannot be equal to Y. there is no bar underneath the symbol.
