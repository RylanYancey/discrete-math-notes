# Unit 1.1 - Sets

## Definitions

set = collection of objects.

$$A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$

order does not matter in a set.
every element in a set is unique. 

large sets are described by listing a property.

$$B = \\{x | x \text{ is a positive, even integer} \\}$$

a set may also contain any kind of elements whatsoever, and they need not be the same type.

$$C = \\{4.5, \text{Lady Gaga}, \pi, 14\\}$$

sets may also contain sets within themselves.
